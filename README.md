# VUE Codecademy tutorial

# Project:

As we were given an option during this phase of achievements to work with a front-end framework, I decided to start learning Vue.js on codecademy.com. I only finished the first part of the course which inluded the intro, set-up, templates and directives. Even though it did not seem like much, I found these tools to be surprisingly dynamic and powerful.

# Action: 

Now having begun the project portion of the course, we were asked to create a sort of twitter clone where user info and tweets can be recorded and updated dynamically. A lot of early code was given to start us off but the main takeaway was to display the power of templates and directives and how it makes it so mauch easier and faster to write seemingly complex javasrcipt methods right in the HTML! For example, in the vue app I am using the "v-for" directive which dynamically creates a list of items through a "for" loop and displays it on the page. I found this functionality especially amazing. One major problem I did encounter with this project is that I could not figure out how to get it to work with npm through the command line rather than just using a "cdn". Fortunately though, I'm sure as I continue in the tutorial I will be taught how to accomplish that.

# Result: 

In the end I was happy with the knowledge I gained from this short tutorial, and I am really starting to see why front-end js frameworks are so powerful and widely used in the industry.
